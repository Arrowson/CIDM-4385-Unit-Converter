### Description of Project

This is a tool to be used to change from the metric system
to the Imperial system of measurements. Included are formulas 
for, *Volume, Mass, and Length*.


##### Problems/ bugs resolved

The most difficult part was less the coding and more about the 
management of the system. I'm sure there's an easier/better way to accomplish
the task, but I basically made copies of the functions that proved relevant.

```
		ucc.selected_Number = ucc.lengthValue.toString();
		ucc.selected_Number1 = ucc.lengthValue1.toString();
		ucc.selected_Number2 = ucc.lengthValue2.toString();
		
//*****************************************************************************		
		
		ucc.Iselected_Number = ucc.IlengthValue.toString();
		ucc.Iselected_Number1 = ucc.IlengthValue1.toString();
		ucc.Iselected_Number2 = ucc.IlengthValue2.toString();

```

this is just an example, I used the lines of *'s to differentiate for myself
